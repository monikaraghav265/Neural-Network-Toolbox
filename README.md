# Neural Network Toolbox

This project is a simple Neural Network Toolbox built using Python and Streamlit.

## Features
- Upload CSV dataset
- Train neural network using backpropagation
- Set epochs and learning rate
- View loss vs epoch graph
- Generate predictions

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Streamlit
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib

## How to Run
1. Install required libraries:
   pip install -r requirements.txt

2. Run the app:
   streamlit run app.py

## Dataset Format
The last column of the CSV file should be the output (target).
